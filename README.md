# downer
## A Markdown to HTML Python 3 module.

Provides a Markdown-to-HTML function that will take a string formatted with Markdown text and return a string with the equivalent HTML.
Uses the syntax as described in [markdownguide.org](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/). Support for non-standard Markdown flavors has been considered but is not a current goal of this project.
